## Notice
The current version is working with Xcode Version 8.

## Description
For Udacity students, this app will display a map that shows information posted by other students. 
The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. 
By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. 
The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.

* Multiple views of content
* Core Location and MapKit
